# Coyote
Hey there! Welcome to Coyote: The Anti-Theme. I was going to call it Coyote 2: Through the Portal of Time, but that was already taken.
Regardless, go ahead and check out coyote-instructions.txt for full installation and usage documentation. If you're
already familiar with wordpress theme usage, you can skip to coyote-cheat-sheet.txt for some handy directions on using the 
built in tools.

This is most definitely a beta release so feel free to get ahold of me at coyotetheme@gmail.com with any bugs/problems/questions/comments.
I will be continuing to add tools to the theme...when I feel like it.

Enjoy!
